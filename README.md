## Getting started (dev)
* `npm install`

* `nodemon server.js`

Dev server should now serve files from http://localhost:4000. React components should be auto-updated, without need of browser refresh. 
Regular server will serve files from http://localhost:8000! We are using it currently as an endpoint which our dev server pings to grab data.
