# Fantasy Game of Thrones

----
## Introduction
see [Game of Thrones Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones)
and [The Inspiration](http://www.theverge.com/2015/4/10/8382395/the-game-of-game-of-thrones-who-will-win-season-five)

This provides a platform for a Game of Thrones fantasy league.

## Tech Stack

React/Redux + Node/Express + Sequelize/MySQL

----
## Getting started (dev)
* In the root directory: `touch .env`
  * Copy and paste the following into your .env:
  ```
  NODE_ENV=development
  PORT=8000
  DB_URL=http://localhost:2391
  DB_NAME=got
  DB_USER=root
  DB_PORT=2391
  ```
* `npm install`
* `npm install -g babel-cli`
* Check to make sure you have a database called 'got' in mysql:
  * In your terminal: `mysql -u root`
  * Then (you should now be in the mysql cli): `show databases;`
  * If you have 'got', you're fine.
  * Else, `create database got;`
  * You can now exit mysql
* In one terminal window: `npm start`
* In another terminal window: `npm run db`
* In another terminal window: `npm run watch`
* In another terminal window: `npm run dev`

Dev server should now serve files from http://localhost:4000. React components should be auto-updated, without need of browser refresh. 
Regular server will serve files from http://localhost:8000! We are using it currently as an endpoint which our dev server pings to grab data.
The database has its own server, which should be operating on port 2391.

## To use Redux Dev Tools (time travel etc)
Go to webpack.config.js and change NODE_ENV to `JSON.stringify('development')`
